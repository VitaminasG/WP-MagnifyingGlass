# WP-MagnifyingGlass
Contract style WP plugin to expand a user personal data input and output for Admin role to read it.

The Plugin was designed and tested to work with WordPress v4.9.4 and Bootstrap v4.1.0. To make a plugin as a stable version, some Bootstrap css and Js files was added to plugin but not referenced from external source except one [line](https://github.com/VitaminasG/WP-MagnifyingGlass/blob/857e4b72907c3ab786f71974e96c9cbbfa72b4e0/includes/core-functions.php#L16).

Please feel free to explore and add any modifications to the code to adjust to your needs. To get your desirable user form you will need to change a form inputs and Ajax requests to validate empty fields and output errors correctly.

There is no link to demo, as is required to have a WordPress CMS installed on the server to operate the plugin.
